<SYNOPSIS>
Calculates the absorption of X-rays by the ISM for modeling redshifted
absorption. Does not include a dust component.
XSpec model.
</SYNOPSIS>

<DESC>
<PARA>
The Tuebingen-Boulder ISM absorption model. This model calculates the
cross-section for X-ray absorption by the ISM as the sum of the
cross-sections for X-ray absorption due to the gas-phase ISM and the
molecules in the ISM. In the molecular contribution to the ISM
cross-section, only molecular hydrogen is considered. In the gas-phase
ISM, the cross-section is the sum of the photoionization
cross-sections of the different elements, weighted by abundance and
taking
into account depletion onto grains. In addition to the updates to the
photoionization cross-sections, the gas-phase cross-section differs
from previous values as a result of updates to the ISM
abundances. Details of updates to the photoionization cross-sections
as well as to abundances can be found in Wilms, Allen and McCray
(2000, ApJ 542, 914). Note that this model differs from xstbabs in that
grains are not included.

<PARA>
     This is a multiplicative model component.
