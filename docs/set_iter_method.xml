<SYNOPSIS>
      Set the iterative fitting method
</SYNOPSIS>

    <SYNTAX>
      <LINE>set_iter_method(name)</LINE>
    </SYNTAX>

    <DESC>
      <PARA>
	The set_iter_method command is used to set the current iterative
        fitting method to either "none" (default), "primini", or
        "sigmarej". All available iterative fitting
	methods are returned by the list_iter_methods command, and the
        name of the current iterative fitting method is returned 
        by the get_iter_method_name command. The
	essence of an iterative fitting method is that the chosen fit
        optimization method can be called several times, until some
        criterion is met. The fit statistic and optimization methods are 
        selected independently of the iterative fitting method.     
      </PARA>

      <LIST>
        <ITEM>
          name = name of an iterative fitting method, either "none"
        (default), "primini", or "sigmarej"
        </ITEM>
      </LIST>

      <PARA>
       If the iterative fitting method is "none", then no iterative
       fitting is done when "fit()" is called; the optimization method is called once, and Sherpa otherwise operates as expected.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
       Primini's method is used for re-calculating statistical
       errors using the best-fit model parameters from the *previous*
       fit, until the fit can no longer be improved.
      </PARA>

    
      <PARA>
         The sigma-rejection method is based on the IRAF SFIT
         function.  In successive fits, data points for which ((data -
         model) / error) exceeds some threshold are added to the
         filter, and automatically excluded from the next fit.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
        Primini's method and sigma-rejection can only be called when
        the fit statistic is a chi-squared statistic; it cannot be used with
	least-squares, Cash or C-statistic.

          <PARA>
	    Primini's method is set as the iterative fitting method for fitting data set 1.  When "fit()" is run, the Nelder-Mead optimization
      method is called until the fit can no longer be improved.

	<DESC>
          <PARA>
	   Data set 2 is to be fit without iterative fitting, therefore the current iterative fitting method is changed from "primini" to "none". The Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method is called once during the fit to data set 2.

          <PARA>
	   The sigma-rejection iterative fitting method is used in the
        simultaneous fitting of data sets 2 and 3. When "fit(2,3)" is run,
        the Nelder-Mead optimization method is called until the fit
        can no longer be improved.
