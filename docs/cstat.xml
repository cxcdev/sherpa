	<SYNOPSIS>
      A maximum likelihood function
    </SYNOPSIS>

    <DESC>
      <PARA>
        The cstat statistic is equivalent to the XSPEC implementation
        of the Cash statistic.  
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
        Counts are sampled from the Poisson distribution, and so the
	best way to assess the quality of model fits is to use the 
	product of individual Poisson probabilities computed in each
	bin i, or the
	likelihood L: 
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	<EQUATION>
	    L = (product)_i [ M(i)^N(i)/N(i)! ] * exp[-M(i)]
	  </EQUATION>
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
 	where M(i) = S(i) + B(i)
	is the sum of source and background model amplitudes,
	and D(i) is the number of observed
	counts, in bin i. 
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	The cstat statistic (Cash 1979, ApJ 228, 939) is derived by
	(1) taking the logarithm of the likelihood function, (2)
	changing its sign, (3) dropping the factorial term (which
	remains constant during fits to the same dataset), (4) adding
	an extra data-dependent term, and (4) multiplying by two:
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	<EQUATION>
	    C = 2 * (sum)_i [ M(i) - D(i) + D(i)*[log D(i) - log M(i)] ]
	  </EQUATION>
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	The factor of two exists so that the change in cstat statistic
	from one model fit to the
	next, (Delta)C,  is distributed
	approximately
	as (Delta)chi-square when
	the number of counts in each bin is high (&gt; 5). One can
	then in principle use (Delta)C
	instead
	of (Delta)chi-square in
	certain model comparison tests. However,
	unlike chi-square, the cstat
	statistic may be used regardless of the number of counts in
	each bin. 
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	The advantage of cstat over Sherpa's implementation
	of cash is that one can assign an approximate goodness-of-fit
	measure to a given value of the cstat statistic, i.e. the
	observed statistic, divided by the number of degrees of
	freedom, should be of order 1 for good fits. 
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Background Subtraction">
	The background should not be subtracted from the data when
	this statistic is used.  It should be modeled simultaneously
	with the source.
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Zero and negative value numbers">
	The C-stat statistic function evaluates the logarithm of each
	data point. If the number of counts is zero or negative, it's
	not possible to take the log of that number.   The behavior in
	this case is controlled by the truncate and trunc_value
	settings in the .sherpa.rc file; see <HREF link="http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/sherparc.html">"ahelp sherparc"</HREF> for
	details on this file.
      </PARA>
      
      <PARA>
	If truncate is set to True (the default), then
	log(&lt;trunc_value&gt;) is substituted into the equation, and  
	the statistics calculation proceeds.   The default trunc_value
	is 1.0e-25.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	If truncate is set to False, C-stat returns an error
	and stops the calculation when the number of counts in a bin
	is zero or negative.   The trunc_value setting is not used.
