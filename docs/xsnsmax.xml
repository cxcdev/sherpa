<SYNOPSIS>
Neutron Star Magnetic Atmosphere.
XSpec model.
</SYNOPSIS>
	<DESC>
<PARA>
This model interpolates from a grid of neutron star (NS) atmosphere
spectra to produce a final spectrum that depends on the parameters
listed below. The atmosphere spectra are obtained using the latest
equation of state and opacity results for a partially ionized,
strongly magnetized hydrogen or mid-Z element plasma. The models are
constructed by solving the coupled radiative transfer equations for
the two photon polarization modes in a magnetized medium, and the
atmosphere is in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium. The atmosphere
models mainly depend on the surface effective temperature Teff and
magnetic field strength B and inclination ΘB; there is also a
dependence on the surface gravity g=(1+zg)GM/R2, where
1+zg=(1-2GM/R)-1/2 is the gravitational redshift and M and R are the
NS mass and radius, respectively. 
</PARA>

<PARA>
Two sets of models are given: one set with a single surface B and Teff
and a set which is constructed with B and Teff varying across the
surface according to the magnetic dipole model (for the latter, θm is
the angle between the direction to the observer and the magnetic
axis). The effective temperatures span the range log Teff=5.5-6.8 for
hydrogen and log Teff.=5.8-6.9 for mid-Z elements(note: for the
latter, change temperature range in nsmax_lmodel.dat) The models with
single (B,Teff) cover the energy range 0.05-10 keV, while the models
with (B,Teff)-distributions cover the range 0.09-5 keV.

     This is an additive model component.
