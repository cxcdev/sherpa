	<SYNOPSIS>
     List all current model IDs.

       Sherpa allows users to construct arbitrarily complex models
       from model components (e.g., Gaussians, Lorentzians, XSPEC
       models, etc.).  These model expressions can then be assigned to
       Sherpa data sets, so that the models can be fit to
       the data.  This function lists the IDs of all current, active models
       in a Sherpa session, i.e., all models which have been assigned
       to a data set to be fit. A model ID is the same as the ID of the
       data set to which it has been assigned, though the user has the
       option to
       assign an alternate model ID to a given model with the set_model
       command. However, in this case, the list_model_ids() function
       will return both the user-defined model ID *and* the ID
       of the data set to which that model has been assigned.  The
       list_model_ids() function accepts no input arguments.

	    The list_model_ids() function lists the model IDs
            of all active models in a Sherpa session. A model ID is
            the same as the ID of the data set to which it has been
            assigned.  If a user assigns an alternate ID to a model,
            such as "bkg_model", both the user-defined model
            ID *and* the ID of the associated data set will be
            returned by list_model_ids(). (In this example, the set_model
            function is used to assign models to four data sets, as well
            as to assign a string model ID to a model expression.)
