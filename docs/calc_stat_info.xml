         The calc_stat_info() function is the CIAO 4 version of the
         GOODNESS function in CIAO 3.4; it returns the goodness-of-fit
         statistics associated with a data set and its assigned model. The advantage it offers
         over the other Sherpa functions which return similar information,
         e.g. fit() and get_fit_results(), is that it returns
         statistics on individual data sets included in a simultaneous fit,
         plus the statistics of the simultaneous fit, 
         whereas the other functions would only return the statistics of the
         simultaneous fit.  The get_stat_info() function is available
         for parsing the information returned by calc_stat_info(), e.g.
         so that it can be stored in variables and therefore easily accessed and manipulated within a script.

      <PARA>
      The calc_stat_info() functions returns the following information
      about how well the specified models fit the data:

      <PARA>
        This function accepts no
         arguments; it returns the fit statistics for all data
         sets which have been assigned models, including background
        data sets associated with source data sets. This means that if a
         fit has not yet been performed in the
         Sherpa session, calc_stat_info() will return
         not-very-meaningful statistics for data sets which have
         been assigned models but which have not yet been fit. Also,
         if a fit has been performed for only some of the data sets
         with assigned models, those data sets which were not explicitly fit
         will be included in the simultaneous fit results returned by calc_stat_info()
         (see an example of this behavior below in the examples section).

	   The calc_stat_info() function is used to return the
      goodness-of-fit statistics resulting from the fit of an absorbed
      power law model to background-subtracted data set 1. The
      get_stat_info() function is used to store this information to
      variable "f", and variable "f" is used to access the reduced
      statistic value contained in the calc_stat_info() results.
