This model gives the reflected X-ray spectrum from a cold, optically
thick, circular slab with inner and outer radii Ri and Ro
respectively, illuminated by a point source a height H above the
centre of the slab. The main difference between this and other
reflection models is that analytic approximations are used for the
Chandrasekar H functions (and their integrals) and ELASTIC SCATTERING
is assumed (see Basko 1978, ApJ, 223, 268). The elastic scattering
approximation means that the model is ONLY VALID UP TO ~ 15 keV in the
source frame. Future enhancements will include fudge factors which
will allow extension up to 100 keV. The fact that no integration is
involved at any point makes the routine very fast and particularly
suitable for generating error contours, especially when fitting a
large number of data channels.The model is multiplicative so can be
used with ANY incident continuum.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Suppose the incident photon spectrum is N(E) photons/cm/cm/s/keV and
that the incident continuum is steady in time and further that the
reflected continuum from the slab is R(E). When you multiply the
incident spectrum with HREFL, what you actually get is
</PARA>

<PARA>
<EQUATION>
  M(E) = escfrac * N(E) + covfac * R(E)
</EQUATION>
</PARA>

<PARA>
Thus, the actual physical situation described above corresponds to
Escfrac=1.0 and covfac=1.0. You may decide to float Escfrac and/or
covfac. In that case, you must decide for your particular case what
the best-fitting values of these parameters mean physically. It may
imply time-lags between the direct and reflected components, different
source and/or disk geometries to those assumed or something else.
