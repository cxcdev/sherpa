<SYNOPSIS>
      Return the value of the specified option for the current iterative fitting method
</SYNOPSIS>

    <SYNTAX>
      <LINE>get_iter_method_opt()[option]</LINE>
    </SYNTAX>

    <DESC>
      <PARA> 
        The get_iter_method_opt command prints the value of the named option
        for the current iterative fitting method; if no argument is
        given, it lists all options and their associated values. The
        name of the current iterative fitting method can be printed
	with the get_iter_method_name command (default is "none"), and
        the iterative fitting method can be set to "none", "primini", or "sigmarej" with the
        set_iter_method command (see "ahelp get_iter_method_name" and
        "ahelp set_iter_method").  All available iterative fitting
	methods are returned by the list_iter_methods command. The
	essence of an iterative fitting method is that the chosen fit
        optimization method can be called several times, until some
        criterion is met. The fit statistic and optimization methods are 
        selected independently of the iterative fitting method.     
      </PARA>
    
      <LIST>
        <ITEM>
         option - the name of the iterative fitting option whose value
         should be returned
        </ITEM>
      </LIST>

      <PARA>
       If the iterative fitting method is "none", then no iterative
       fitting is done when "fit()" is called; the optimization method
       is called once, and Sherpa otherwise operates as expected.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
       Primini's method is used for re-calculating statistical
       errors using the best-fit model parameters from the *previous*
       fit, until the fit can no longer be improved.
      </PARA>

          <PARA>
       The options which may be edited for Primini's method are:
      </PARA>
      
<LIST>
        <ITEM>
	  maxiters - maximum number of iterations to perform, even if
        the fit statistic has not converged
        </ITEM>
	<ITEM>
	  name - name of the current iterative fitting method
        </ITEM>
	<ITEM>
	  tol  - the iterative fitting is stopped when the statistic
        varies by less than the tolerance value between iterations. 
        </ITEM>
      </LIST>


      <PARA>
         The sigma-rejection method is based on the IRAF SFIT
         function.  In successive fits, data points for which ((data -
         model) / error) exceeds some threshold are added to the
         filter, and automatically excluded from the next fit. Iterations cease when there is no change in the filter from one iteration to the next, or when the fit has iterated a user-specified maximum number of times.

      <PARA>
         The options which may be edited for sigma-rejection are:

<LIST>
        <ITEM>
	  lrej - data point rejection criterion in units of sigma, for data points below the model

        </ITEM>
        <ITEM>
           maxiters -  maximum number of iterations to perform in the
        fit (if 0, the fit will run to convergence, i.e., until there is no change in the filter)
        </ITEM>
        <ITEM>
          grow  - rejection growing radius (when a given data point is to be filtered out, this parameter sets the number of  pixels adjacent to that pixel which are also to be filtered out; i.e., if 0, only the data point itself is  filtered out; if 1, the data point and its two immediate neighbors are filtered out, and so on)
        </ITEM>
        <ITEM>
         name - name of the current iterative fitting method
	</ITEM>
        <ITEM>
         hrej -  data point rejection criterion in units of sigma, for data points above the model
	</ITEM>
      </LIST>

      <PARA>
        Primini's method and sigma-rejection can only be called when
        the fit statistic is a chi-squared statistic; it cannot be used with
	least-squares, Cash or C-statistic.

	    No iterative fitting method has been set (default is
        'none'), therefore no iterative fitting is done when data set 2 is fit; the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method is called once.  In this case, only the name of the current iterative fitting method is printed when get_iter_method_opt() is called (which is 'none').

	   The sigma-rejection iterative fitting method is used in the
        simultaneous fitting of data sets 2 and 3. The full list of
        available options and associated values for this method are
        returned with get_iter_method_opt(); the maximum number of
        iterations for this method is set to 10 with set_iter_method_opt; and the
        changed value of 'maxiters' is checked with 'get_iter_method_opt()["maxiters"]'.
