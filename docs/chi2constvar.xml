	<SYNOPSIS>
      Chi-square statistic with constant variance computed from the
      counts data. 
    </SYNOPSIS>

    <DESC>
      <PARA>
        The chi2constvar statistic was named CHI PARENT or CHI CVAR in
        CIAO 3.4. 
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	In some applications, analysts have seen fit to assume that
	the variance is constant for each bin.  For this choice of
	statistic, the variance is assumed to be the mean number of
	counts, or

	where N is the number of on-source (and
	off-source) bins included in the fit.  The background term
	appears only if a background region is
	specified and background subtraction is done.  The help file
        on the chi-square statistic has more information, including
        definitions of the additional quantities in the equation:
