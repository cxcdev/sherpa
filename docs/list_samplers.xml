	The Sherpa list_samplers command returns the list of available
         samplers, or jumping rules, available for use in the 
         algorithm.  is a sophisticated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based algorithm designed to carry out Bayesian Low-Count X-ray
         Spectral (BLoCXS) analysis in the Sherpa environment.  The
         algorithm explores parameter space at a suspected minimum
         using a predefined Sherpa model to high-energy X-ray spectral
         data.

      <PARA>
	"MH" is Metropolis-Hastings, which
	always jumps from the best-fit; "MetropolisMH" is
	Metropolis with Metropolis-Hastings that jumps from the
	best-fit with probability 'p_M', else it jumps from the last
	accepted jump. "PragBayes" is used when effective area calibration uncertainty is to be included in the calculation.  (At each nominal MCMC
iteration, a new calibration product is generated, and a series
of N (option in set_sampler_opt) MCMC sub-iteration steps are
carried out, choosing between Metropolis and Metropolis-Hastings
types of samplers with probability p_M (option in set_sampler_opt).
Only the last of these sub-iterations are kept in the chain.)

        The get_sampler* and set_sampler* functions are available for
        accessing and modifying the attributes of each sampler type;
        see the corresponding ahelp files for details (e.g., <HREF link="http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/get_sampler.html">"ahelp get_sampler"</HREF>).
