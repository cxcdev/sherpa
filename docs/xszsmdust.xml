<SYNOPSIS>
Extinction by dust grains in starburst galaxies.
XSpec model.
</SYNOPSIS>

<DESC>
<PARA>
  Extinction by dust grains suited to starburst galaxies and the hosts
  of gamma ray bursts. The model can be applied over the IR, optical
  and UV energy bands, including the full energy ranges of the Swift
  UVOT and XMM-Newton OM detectors. The transmission is set to unity
  shortward of 912 Angstroms in the rest frame of the dust. This is
  incorrect physically but does allow the model to be used in
  combination with an X-ray photoelectric absorption model such as
  xsphabs. The extinction curve contains no spectral features and is
  characterized by a powerlaw slope over spectral wavelength. This
  model has been justified by e.g. Savaglio &amp; Fall (2004, ApJ, 614,
  293) because the apparent low metallicities within GRB hosts result
  in no significant spectral features within the extinction curve,
  unlike those found in local galaxies.

  Standard values for Rv are Milky Way = 3.08, LMC = 3.16
  and SMC = 2.93 (from table 2 of Pei 1992, ApJ, 395, 130), although
  these may not be applicable to more distant dusty sources.

     This is a multiplicative model component.
